# gorefer

## What is gorefer?
Gorefer is the tool to analyze packages written in golang and visualize dependencies of functions and types in the target packages.
It analyze golang source files and output json files and dot language format files.

## Future work
It works only a single package now. So I'll make it work for the some project made from many pakcages.
I'll make web console.
